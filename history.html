            Basketball was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a Canadian teacher who created the game in Springfield, Massachusetts, to keep his students active indoors during the winter. 
            He used a soccer ball and two peach baskets, and the game originally had 13 simple rules with no dribbling. The sport quickly spread through schools and YMCAs, 
            eventually leading to college and professional play. In 1949, the NBA (National Basketball Association) was formed, becoming the worldâ€™s top professional league. Over time, 
            basketball grew into a global sport with millions of fans and players worldwide.
