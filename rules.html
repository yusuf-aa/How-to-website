        <div class="intro">
            Basketball is a fast-paced team sport with relatively simple core rules. 
            The objective for each team is to score points by shooting the ball through the opposing teamâ€™s hoop, which is mounted 10 feet high on a backboard at each end of the court. 
            At the same time, teams must work together to defend their own hoop, preventing the other team from scoring. Each team has five players on the court, 
            and the game is played in four quarters. Players use a combination of passing, dribbling, and shooting to move the ball and create scoring opportunities, 
            while also employing strategies like man-to-man or zone defense to protect their basket. Success in basketball comes not just from individual skill, 
            but from teamwork, coordination, and quick decision-making on both offense and defense.
